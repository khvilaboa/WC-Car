# WC-Car

WC Car is an python script that involves a client side software that, with help of xinput, provides a game-like experience of running a RC-Car over network, using the server software.

This software needs a specific wiring and RC-Car setup that, for now, we're not showing, as it is in testing. It is meant to be running of a Raspberry Pi through GPIO headers connected to the RC-Car electronics.

We aim to make a remote controlled WiFi car with live videostream and, maybe, microphone and speakers to communicate.

Just a fun project :)
